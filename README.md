# zope_web-archive
A web archive based on Zope2.

Old but good technology 

I tried to dockerize it, that is the result.
A skeleton of the APP is needed by the Dockerfile, it contains the needed Zope products, some modified by me, and a minimum data.fs file.

Feel free to contact me in case you try it and have issues...
